# Stegnography

# 🔍 Overview
This project implements Steganography, the art of hiding secret information within non-secret files such as images. It focuses on encoding and decoding messages using image-based techniques in Python, particularly through a Jupyter Notebook (Stegnography_Project.ipynb).

# 🧠 Features
🔐 Hide (encode) text messages inside images

🔓 Extract (decode) hidden messages from stego images

🖼️ Uses standard image processing libraries like OpenCV or PIL

📚 Written in Python and runnable in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

PIL (Pillow) or OpenCV

NumPy

# 📦 Installation

# Clone the repository or download the project files:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Steganography_Project.git

cd Steganography_Project

# Install the required libraries:
pip install numpy pillow opencv-python

# 🚀 How to Run
1.Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Stegnography_Project.ipynb

2.Follow the cells to:
Upload an image

Enter a secret message

Encode and save the stego image

Decode the hidden message
